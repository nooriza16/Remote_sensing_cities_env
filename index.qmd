This is a Quarto book to document my learning journey in **Remote Sensing Cities and Environments** course during my time at CASA UCL 24/25, offering insights learned, its applications, and my own reflections. The module is based on Dr Andrew Maclachlan github page \[[here](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/.)\].

\*For those of you who also want to learn Geographic Information Scicene beyond 'typical GIS' Software, as in use R-Studio, you could also visit his other github page \[[here](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/index.html)\].

## Introduction

Hi, Iâ€™m Nooriza, a student currently pursuing a Master's degree in Urban Spatial Science at UCL. I have an academic background in Geography with a specialization in Regional Development Studies and have several substantial work experience in government consultancies in Indonesia.

## Why do I choose this module?

The reason I choose remote sensing is because I want to use its vast open resources to analysis various topics. I had learned the foundations during my undergraduate degree but I haven't delved further into it and haven't got any experience to use GEE yet. Thus, I hope at the end of this class, I will get knowledge on to get alternative of spatial data using remote sensing plus analyse various topic across different scale using GEE.

Remote sensing is also an interesting field as it could produce wealth of information without direct contact. Don't you think learning remote sensing makes us have the eye of the bird even beyond? I mean we agree that remote sensing offers perspectives far beyond what our human eyes can naturally perceive : *allowing* to *see things from above and to see the unseen of the naked eye.*

For example, see the ASTER images of San Fransisco Bay above it highlights different object such as vegetation (upper left); soil & rocks in mountainous area (upper right); urban materials (lower left) ; and water temperature (lower right).

Practically, learning this course will, hopefully, help me address the challenges I faced during my previous work in Indonesia. For example, while working on a project focused on healthcare accessibility across hundreds of small islands, we struggled to obtain real-time data to identify which islands were inhabited and which were not. Additionally, we faced challenges in determining which islands had ports suitable for docking ships. I believe that applying remote sensing data is both cost- and time-efficient in helping the government maintain more precise and up-to-date data, which is particularly important in world's largest archipelago country like Indonesia.
