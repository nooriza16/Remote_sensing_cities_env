This is a Quarto book to document my learning journey in **Remote Sensing Cities and Environments** course during my time at CASA UCL 24/25, offering lessons and insights learned, applications, and reflections. The module is based on this <https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/>.

For you who also want to learn Geographic Information Scicen beyond typical GIS Software, as in use R-Studio, you could also visit Dr Andrew Mclahan github page : <https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/index.html>.

## Introduction

Hi, Iâ€™m Nooriza, a student currently pursuing a Master's degree in Urban Spatial Science at UCL. I have an academic background in Geography with a specialization in Regional Development Studies and have gained substantial work experience in government consultancies in Indonesia.

## Why do I choose this module?

Learning this course will, hopefully, help me address the challenges I faced during my previous work. For example, while working on a project focused on healthcare accessibility across hundreds of small islands, we struggled to obtain real-time data to identify which islands were inhabited and which were not. Additionally, we faced challenges in determining which islands had ports suitable for docking ships. I believe that applying remote sensing data is both cost- and time-efficient in helping the government maintain more precise and up-to-date data, which is particularly important in large and complex regions like Indonesia.

Another thing motivated me to take Remote Sensing course is the desire to know *how it feels to be a bird and to see the unseen.* Don't we agree that remote sensing offers perspectives far beyond what our human eyes can naturally perceive?

Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my learning experience. Hope it helps!
