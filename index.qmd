This is a Quarto book to document my learning journey in **Remote Sensing Cities and Environments** course during my time at CASA UCL 24/25, offering insights learned, its applications, and my own reflections. The module is based on Dr Andrew Maclachlan github page \[[here](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/.)\].

\*For those of you who also want to learn Geographic Information Scicene beyond 'typical GIS' Software, as in use R-Studio, you could also visit his other github page \[[here](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/index.html)\].

## Introduction

Hi, Iâ€™m Nooriza, a student currently pursuing a Master's degree in Urban Spatial Science at UCL. I have an academic background in Geography with a specialization in Regional Development Studies and have several substantial work experience in government consultancies in Indonesia.

## Why do I choose this module?

The reason I take Remote Sensing course is my desire to know *how it feels to be a bird, seeing things from above, and to see the unseen.* Don't we agree that remote sensing offers perspectives far beyond what our human eyes can naturally perceive?

Meanwhile, practically, learning this course will, hopefully, help me address the challenges I faced during my previous work in Indonesia. For example, while working on a project focused on healthcare accessibility across hundreds of small islands, we struggled to obtain real-time data to identify which islands were inhabited and which were not. Additionally, we faced challenges in determining which islands had ports suitable for docking ships. I believe that applying remote sensing data is both cost- and time-efficient in helping the government maintain more precise and up-to-date data, which is particularly important in world's largest archipelago country like Indonesia.
