This is a Quarto book to document my learning journey in **Remote Sensing Cities and Environments** course during my time at CASA UCL 24/25, offering insights learned, its applications, and my own reflections. The module is based on Dr Andrew Maclachlan github page \[[here](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/.)\]. For those of you who also want to learn Geographic Information Science beyond 'typical GIS' Software, as in use R-Studio, you could also visit his other github page \[[here](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/index.html)\].

The lecturers in this course are Dr. Andrew Maclachlan—referred to Andy in this learning diary—and Dr. Ollie Ballinger—referred to as Ollie.

# Introduction

Hi, I’m Nooriza Maharani, a student currently pursuing a Master's degree in Urban Spatial Science at UCL. I graduated with a degree in Geography, specializing in Regional Development Studies. Over the past five years, I have worked as a technical consultant for various governments in Indonesia, both local or ministry level, ensuring that their decision-making is data-driven. Although the results often need to pass through political and budgeting reviews, that's essentially what I do. Over the years, I have assisted local governments in Indonesia managing and utilizing spatial data to support various agendas, including land management, land consolidation, disaster risk assessment, accessibility analysis, and the development of both basic and thematic databases.

Honestly, I don't have a specific topic of interest to add here because I have many! From health to art, from sport analytic to social analytic. I love to connect them all with spatial. That's why I chose an interdisciplinary course at CASA. One thing for sure is that I love doing analytics for social good. I love to look beyond tools and methodologies, focusing instead on the challenges we can address using these methods. In the end, all the sophisticated methodologies and cutting-edge technical tools are meaningful when we use them to address challenges and solve problems, right?

# Why do I choose this module?

The reason I choose remote sensing is because I want to use its vast open resources to analysis various topics. I had learned the foundations during my undergraduate degree but I haven't delved further into it and haven't got any experience to use GEE yet. Thus, I hope at the end of this class, I will get knowledge on to get alternative of spatial data using remote sensing plus analyse various topic across different scale using GEE.

Remote sensing is also an interesting field as it could produce wealth of information without direct contact. Don't you think learning remote sensing makes us have the eye of the bird even beyond? I mean we agree that remote sensing offers perspectives far beyond what our human eyes can naturally perceive such as *allowing* to *see things from above and to see the unseen with the naked eye.*

For example, see the ASTER images of San Fransisco Bay below it highlights different object such as vegetation (upper left); soil & rocks in mountainous area (upper right); urban materials (lower left) ; and water temperature (lower right). All from one image...that's cool !

Practically, learning this course will, hopefully, help me address the challenges I faced during my previous work in Indonesia. For example, while working on a project focused on healthcare accessibility across hundreds of small islands, we struggled to obtain latest data to identify which islands were inhabited and which were not. Additionally, we faced challenges in determining which islands had ports suitable for docking ships. I believe that applying remote sensing data is both cost- and time-efficient in helping the government maintain more precise and up-to-date data, which is particularly important in world's largest archipelago country like Indonesia.
