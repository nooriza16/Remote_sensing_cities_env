The module is based on Dr Andrew Maclachlan github page [here].\n*For those of you who also want to learn Geographic Information Scicene beyond ‘typical GIS’ Software, as in use R-Studio, you could also visit his other github page [here]."

    "text": "1.2 Why do I choose this module?\nThe reason I take Remote Sensing course is my desire to know how it feels to be a bird, seeing things from above, and to see the unseen. Don’t we agree that remote sensing offers perspectives far beyond what our human eyes can naturally perceive?\n\nsource : Biomimicry and Birds\n\n\n\n\n\nsource : NASA/JPL\nFor example the ASTER images of San Fransisco Bay above, it highlights different object such as vegetation (upper left); soil & rocks in mountainous area (upper right); urban materials (lower left) ; and water temperature (lower right).\nMeanwhile, practically, learning this course will, hopefully, help me address the challenges I faced during my previous work in Indonesia. For example, while working on a project focused on healthcare accessibility across hundreds of small islands, we struggled to obtain real-time data to identify which islands were inhabited and which were not. Additionally, we faced challenges in determining which islands had ports suitable for docking ships. I believe that applying remote sensing data is both cost- and time-efficient in helping the government maintain more precise and up-to-date data, which is particularly important in world’s largest archipelago country like Indonesia.\nFeel free to explore my site to learn more about my learning experience. Hope it helps!"

    "text": "3 Week 1 : Getting to Know Remote Sensing\n\nSneak Peak\n\nThis week is an introduction of Remote Sensing courses, introducing 2 sources of imagery :\n\nLandsat-8\nThe Landsat 8 satellite has a 16-day revisit cycle, meaning it can capture imagery of the same location every 16 day. This period would be advantageous to monitor changes at moderate pace, as its revisit time is every 16 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © NASA\n\n\n\n\n\nSentinel 2A\nSentinel 2 revisits the earth every 5 days (using both satellite A and B), meaning that it provides frequent observations and make it suitable to monitor rapid changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © ESA and AIRBUS Defence & Space.\n\n\n\nEach has their own characteristics, while Sentinel-2A has 10m spatial resolution Landsat-8 has 30m resolution. If we want to compare its spectral resolution we have to either upgrade or downgrade, usually downgrading the higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (10m) to match Landsat’s (30m) is the preferred approach.\n\n\n\n4 Application\nIn what ways can we use Sentinel and Landsat data?\n\nSentinel-2 (operated by ESA) has 13 spectral bands across a wide range of wavelengths, which are especially useful for vegetation monitoring, land cover classification, and agricultural applications.\nLandsat 8 (operated by NASA and USGS) has 11 spectral bands, which cover a similar range of wavelengths to Sentinel-2 but with fewer bands. Landsat 8 provides excellent coverage for land monitoring and vegetation studies as well.\n\nThey both could be used to vegetation monitoring, well……..are they really that difference?\n\nSentinel-2 has more bands overall, with additional Red Edge bands, a higher spatial resolution (10m for key bands), and a Water Vapor band. This makes it more suited for detailed vegetation analysis, agricultural monitoring, and atmospheric studies. In the paper…..\nLandsat 8, while having fewer bands, provides excellent coverage with a broader range of SWIR bands, and the addition of two thermal infrared bands makes it strong for land surface temperature and other thermal analyses."

Well, but this Xaringan is not related to figures in Konoha’s world but related to a certain library in R Studio that enable us to create neat HTML slides in R.\n\n\n5 How’s xaringan look like?"
