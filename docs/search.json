    "text": "5.2 Reflections\nDuring this week, I got a lot of reflections on my mind because finally I found lecture that explicitly bridging the gap of ‘academics’ to real-world policy. One the most important key-takeaway from the lecture is that “some academics papers are too technical, without clearly addressed policy; some policy don’t include academic findings they could benefit for”.\nMy reflections would be:\n\nI resonate a lot with the lecture’s key takeaway as I genuinely think academics and urban governance still have a distance between them. In terms of human resources, that make the adoption of academics finding hard to implement in governments. Besides, government project is based on annual budget which is make it a fast-paced environment that need an immediate output which make them reluctant to go through experimental phase often found in academics processes.\nI used to naively think that all published papers in a renowned journals site near perfect that It would be hard to find its weakness points. Surprisingly after this week’s lecture I found a lot of journals’s weakness point “If I could called it that way” pertaining to application of x y z methods applied to support urban planning does not explicitly link to specific policy. In my opinion, this is one of the reasons why academics and policy-making feel disconnected and fail to effectively influence each other\nWhat have I learnt about policy, city, and the RS data? In my opinion, using Remote Sensing Data on policy-making in city will generate more-informed policy that contained points it often misses such as where is exactly the place “The location” of the targeted policy. Everything happened somewhere. Additionally, it can serve as an alternative when dealing with the unavailability of baseline data.\n\n\n\n\n\nNusantara Capital Authority. 2024. “Nusantara Sustainable Development GOals (SDGs) Voluntary Local Review Baseline.”"

    "text": "1.2 Why do I choose this module?\nThe reason I take Remote Sensing course is my desire to know how it feels to be a bird, seeing things from above, and to see the unseen. Don’t we agree that remote sensing offers perspectives far beyond what our human eyes can naturally perceive?\n\n\n\n\n\nsource : Biomimicry and Birds\n\n\n\n\n\nsource : NASA/JPL\nFor example the ASTER images of San Fransisco Bay above, it highlights different object such as vegetation (upper left); soil & rocks in mountainous area (upper right); urban materials (lower left) ; and water temperature (lower right).\nMeanwhile, practically, learning this course will, hopefully, help me address the challenges I faced during my previous work in Indonesia. For example, while working on a project focused on healthcare accessibility across hundreds of small islands, we struggled to obtain real-time data to identify which islands were inhabited and which were not. Additionally, we faced challenges in determining which islands had ports suitable for docking ships. I believe that applying remote sensing data is both cost- and time-efficient in helping the government maintain more precise and up-to-date data, which is particularly important in world’s largest archipelago country like Indonesia.\nFeel free to explore my site to learn more about my learning experience. Hope it helps!"
