Honestly, I still consider power point provides more themes and more visualization effects that is easily to access compared to Xaringan. However, as I delved further I realize that using Xaringan is providing us with flexibility even such as positioned our picture.\nSo far, I feel like Xaringan is best at incorporating snippet code on presentation or interactive features that usually too heavy to load in power point. Besides, it helps me to give a sense of what html look like."

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nRecently Indonesia planned to move its capital city from Jakarta (in Java islands) into Penajam Paser Utara City (Borneo Islands), as the current capital city, Jakarta, faced an issue of land subsidence at rates up to 22 cm/year Chaussard et al. (2013), overcrowding and prone to disaster risk (both natural and human-driven ) (Bappenas 2021). The term Nusantara is used to name this new capital city, symbolizing the varied geographic settings and cultural diversities.\nAs for the time this published, the Jakarta will remain the capital of the country until the Presidential Decree (Keppres) on the transfer of the capital to Nusantara is issued. The issuance of this decree will depend on the readiness of Nusantara, including the preparation of all supporting systems such as fiscal, human resources, and monetary systems.\n\nFigure 1: The Relocation Settings and Vision. source: (Capital Authority 2024)\nThe analysis is done on initial process, so the detailed planning documents haven’t been launched. Thus, I cited several Governments Published Documents, all of them are publicly available, such as:\n\nNusantara Capital City Handbook [2021]\nNusantara Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Voluntary Local Review Baseline [2024]\nNusantara Biodiversity Management Master Plan [2024]\n\nThe new capital city, Nusantara, is designed as a forest city, with 75% of its designated area being green space. This design aims to create a harmonious blend of urban development as Borneo Islands, is one of the richest biodiversity hotspots in the world.\nHowever, relocating to Nusantara, which is situated near the Borneo rainforest and designed to be a forest city, presents significant challenges. One of the major concerns is mitigating the risks of malaria and other vector-borne diseases, which are prevalent in tropical regions Surendra et al. (2024). The proximity to dense forests and its design to forest city could increase the likelihood of mosquito-borne diseases spreading in the new capital. Thus, addressing these health risks will require comprehensive strategies, including disease prevention measures.\nRemote sensing is one of the instruments that can support these efforts. It allows for the monitoring of environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and vegetation, which are critical for understanding the habitats of disease vectors like mosquitoes.\n[ADD the SDGs Goal]"

    "text": "5.3 Reflections\nDuring this week, I got a lot of reflections on my mind because finally I found lecture that explicitly bridging the gap of ‘academics’ to real-world policy. One the most important key-takeaway from the lecture is that “some academics papers are too technical, without clearly addressed policy; some policy don’t include academic findings they could benefit for”.\nMy reflections would be:\n\nI resonate a lot with the lecture’s key takeaway as I genuinely think academics and urban governance still have a distance between them. In terms of human resources, that make the adoption of academics finding hard to implement in governments. Besides, government project is based on annual budget which is make it a fast-paced environment that need an immediate output which make them reluctant to go through experimental phase often found in academics processes.\nI used to naively think that all published papers in a renowned journals site near perfect that It would be hard to find its weakness points. Surprisingly after this week’s lecture I found a lot of journals’s weakness point “If I could called it that way” pertaining to application of x y z methods applied to support urban planning does not explicitly link to specific policy. In my opinion, this is one of the reasons why academics and policy-making feel disconnected and fail to effectively influence each other\nWhat have I learnt about policy, city, and the RS data? In my opinion, using Remote Sensing Data on policy-making in city will generate more-informed policy that contained points it often misses such as where is exactly the place “The location” of the targeted policy. Everything happened somewhere. Additionally, it can serve as an alternative when dealing with the unavailability of baseline data."
