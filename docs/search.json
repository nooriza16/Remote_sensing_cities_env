    "text": "3.2 Reflections\nFor someone who is not familiar with html, learning Xaringan is definitely challenging compared to powerpoint, as we just usually click tabs on power point. Honestly, I still consider power point provides more themes and more visualization effects that is easily to access compared to Xaringan. However, as I delved further I realize that using Xaringan is providing us with flexibility even such as positioned our picture.\nSo far, I feel like Xaringan is best at incorporating snippet code on presentation or interactive features that usually too heavy to load in power point. Besides, it helps me to give a sense of what html look like."
