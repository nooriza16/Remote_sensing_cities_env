    "text": "1.2 Why do I choose this module?\nThe reason I take Remote Sensing course is my desire to know how it feels to be a bird, seeing things from above, and to see the unseen. Don’t we agree that remote sensing offers perspectives far beyond what our human eyes can naturally perceive?\n\n\n\n\n\nsource : Biomimicry and Birds\n\n\n\n\n\nsource : NASA/JPL\nFor example the ASTER images of San Fransisco Bay above, it highlights different object such as vegetation (upper left); soil & rocks in mountainous area (upper right); urban materials (lower left) ; and water temperature (lower right).\nMeanwhile, practically, learning this course will, hopefully, help me address the challenges I faced during my previous work in Indonesia. For example, while working on a project focused on healthcare accessibility across hundreds of small islands, we struggled to obtain real-time data to identify which islands were inhabited and which were not. Additionally, we faced challenges in determining which islands had ports suitable for docking ships. I believe that applying remote sensing data is both cost- and time-efficient in helping the government maintain more precise and up-to-date data, which is particularly important in world’s largest archipelago country like Indonesia.\nFeel free to explore my site to learn more about my learning experience. Hope it helps!"

    "text": "3 \n\n\n4 Summary\n\nThis week practical is introducing 2 sources of imagery :\na. Landsat-8\nThe Landsat 8 satellite has a 16-day revisit cycle, meaning it can capture imagery of the same location every 16 day. This period would be advantageous to monitor changes at moderate pace, as its revisit time is every 16 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © NASA\n\n\n\nb. Sentinel 2A\nSentinel 2 revisits the earth every 5 days (using both satellite A and B), meaning that it provides frequent observations and make it suitable to monitor rapid changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © ESA and AIRBUS Defence & Space.\n\n\n\nEach has their own characteristics, while Sentinel-2A has 10m spatial resolution Landsat-8 has 30m resolution. If we want to compare its spectral resolution we have to either upgrade or downgrade, usually downgrading the higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (10m) to match Landsat’s (30m) is the preferred approach.\n\n\n\n5 Application\nIn what ways can we use Sentinel and Landsat data?\n\nSentinel-2 (operated by ESA) has 13 spectral bands across a wide range of wavelengths, which are especially useful for vegetation monitoring, land cover classification, and agricultural applications.\nLandsat 8 (operated by NASA and USGS) has 11 spectral bands, which cover a similar range of wavelengths to Sentinel-2 but with fewer bands. Landsat 8 provides excellent coverage for land monitoring and vegetation studies as well.\n\nThey both could be used to vegetation monitoring, well……..are they really that difference?\n\nSentinel-2 has more bands overall, with additional Red Edge bands, a higher spatial resolution (10m for key bands), and a Water Vapor band. This makes it more suited for detailed vegetation analysis, agricultural monitoring, and atmospheric studies. In the paper…..\nLandsat 8, while having fewer bands, provides excellent coverage with a broader range of SWIR bands, and the addition of two thermal infrared bands makes it strong for land surface temperature and other thermal analyses.\n\nReal world application of Sentinel and Landsat 8\n\nLandsat-8 application on detecting of vegetation evolution across China\nThis paper explores 30 years of landsat archive data (spaning of landsat 5 to 8) on 2.125 city to monitor the vegetation evolution. (Han et al. 2025) use reflective bands such as Blue, green, red, NIR and SWIR (1 and 2) and highlighting vegetation characteristics using NDVI, EVI, and OSAVI. The NDVI and RGB bands were further processed to derive texture variables, including variance, contrast, entropy, angular second moment, and correlation. These texture metrics capture spatial patterns and fine-scale structural details of urban vegetation that may not be visible through spectral bands alone. I genuinely believe this finding has the potential to serve as a framework for evaluating the implementation of the government’s long-term plan or the integration of policies across different administrations, which is often difficult to assess due to the extended time frame and transitions between ruling administrations.\n\nFigure 1: A sample result shows urban vegetation degradation in Hangzhou and an increase in vegetation in Zhengzhou. source : (Han et al. 2025).\nSentinel-2 application on plastic debris detecting on coastal area, Brazil\nIn this study, (Nivedita et al. 2024)use 4 sensors of Sentinel Data to detect floating debris. After floating debris is detected they analyze spectral signature to differentiate trash by measuring the mean values of spectral signature of plastic and other materials (such as foam or seaweeds. This research, as part of monitoring marine pollution, could identify critical areas for conservation supports.\n\n\n\nsource :\n\n\nFigure 2: Plastic Debris Detection. Source : (Nivedita et al. 2024)\n\n\n\n6 Reflection\nAfter exploring the application of the two selected satellites, I have concluded that remote sensing data is particularly effective for analyzing large-scale and long-term variations. It can also help mitigate the high costs of manual data collection across vast regions.\nThis insight made me reflect on a similar challenge in my country, Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago. The country needs to identify which small islands are inhabited in order to provide essential services to all of them. To address this, I’m considering using night imagery data as a tool to distinguish inhabited islands from uninhabited ones. The night time would indicate anthropogenic activities that are associated with light at night\n\n\n\n\nHan, Yuan, Jianhua He, Xiaoping Du, Xiao Han, and Yaolin Liu. 2025. “Reconstructing Urban Vegetation Evolution in China Using Multimodal Deep Learning and 30-Years Landsat Archive.” Urban Forestry & Urban Greening 103 (January): 128582. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128582.\n\n\nNivedita, V., S.

    "text": "4 \nLecture this week reminded me of one of powerful figure in Uchiha Clan, the one who can manipulate reality once he activates this-so-called Xaringan. Well, but this Xaringan is not related to figures in Konoha’s world but related to a certain library in R Studio that enable us to create neat HTML slides in R.\n\n\n5 Summary\nxaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(url = “URL of your presentation”, ratio = “16:9”)\n\n\n6 Reflections\nFor someone who is not familiar with html, learning Xaringan is definitely challenging compared to powerpoint, as we just usually click tabs on power point. Honestly, I thought that power point provides more themes, more visualization effects than Xaringan. However, as I delved further I realize that using Xaringan is providing us with flexibility even such as positioned our picture.\nSo far, I feel like Xaringan is best at incorporating snippet code on presentation or interactive features that usually too heavy to load in power point. Besides, it helps me to give a sense of what html look like."
