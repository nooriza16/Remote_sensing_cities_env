## Introduction

Hi, Iâ€™m Nooriza. I graduated with a degree in Regional Development and have several works experience in Indonesia, focusing on data acquisition and analysis for government projects.

During my undergraduate studies, I learned the basics of Remote Sensing. Its importance and wide applications inspired me to dive deeper into the field and apply it to solve real-world problems.
