## Summary

Take a deep breath okaaay? as today’s lecture is quite intense ! The lecture is divided into 2 main points: **how classification is used** and **how to do the classifications**. Classification process in remote sensing often applied in several topics, such as:

| Topics                                    | Sensor                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Urban expansion/sprawl                    | Landsat                                                                                        |
| Land Use Changes on driving air pollution | Sensor : Sentinel 3 Sea & Land Surface Temperature ; Sentinel-5 precursors major air pollution |
| Urban green spaces                        | *Several options such as high, medium resolution imagery ; Lidar-hyperspectral*                |
| Monitoring forest and illegal practices   | Landsat                                                                                        |
| Forest fires                              | landsat                                                                                        |

In practice, classification in remote sensing is combined remote with machine learning techniques that include training data, build classification model, output. Today’s class focus on classification and regression trees (CART) as a method of classification. As a visual learner, I understand the complex materials better, hope it helps you too.

The challenge in using machine learning is OVERFITTING. In simple terms, overfitting happens when a model fits the training data too well but performs poorly on new data. To stop our data to be overfitting, there are many ways to deal with this, such as : (a) Limit how the tree grows (b) Pruning – Remove unnecessary branches after the tree is built to simplify (c) Pruning with Alpha Regularization – Remove leaves, increase the pruning parameter (α) and find the lowest tree score. The goal is to keep the tree small without sacrificing performance. (d) Data Splitting – Divide data into training (to build the tree) and testing (to evaluate performance) sets and find the lowest sum residuals in regression tasks

> How does it apply to imagery?

The idea is to turn each pixel in an image into a specific category, you'd use image segmentation, which labels each pixel based on predefined categories. This applies to both of supervised or unsupervised learning.
