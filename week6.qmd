## Summary

Take a deep breath okaaay? as today’s lecture is quite intense ! The lecture is divided into 2 main points: **how classification is used** and **how to do the classifications**. Classification process in remote sensing often applied in several topics, such as:

+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Topics                                    | Sensor                                                                        |

In practice, classification in remote sensing is combined with machine learning techniques that include training data and testing data. Today’s class focus on classification and regression trees (CART). As a visual learner, learning using this diagram make me understand the complex materials better, hope it helps you too.

One of the challenge using machine learning is OVERFITTING. In simple terms, overfitting happens when a model fits the training data too well but performs poorly on new data. There are many ways to deal with overfitting, such as : (a) Limit how the tree grows (b) Pruning – Remove unnecessary branches after the tree is built to simplify (c) Pruning with Alpha Regularization – Remove leaves, increase the pruning parameter (α) and find the lowest tree score. The goal is to keep the tree small without sacrificing performance. (d) Data Splitting – Divide data into training (to build the tree) and testing (to evaluate performance) sets and find the lowest sum residuals in regression tasks

One more thing, as decision tree is not good with new data we could use another method called random forest. I like to use the Chatgpt analogy on this: a Decision Tree is like asking one expert for advice meanwhile a Random Forest is like asking 100 experts, each with a unique take, then averaging their answers.

> How does it apply to imagery?

The idea is to turn each pixel in an image into a specific category, you'd use image segmentation, which labels each pixel based on predefined categories. This applies to both of supervised or unsupervised learning.

## Application

In my understanding, classification in remote sensing will be easier if object detected having a stark difference. The more differ the object the easier the detection would be. Then I was thinking about dense object with high irregular shape, such as informal settlement. How does the classification work? It must be posing a unique challenge. Thus, I want to explore how the classification of informal settlement in small town of Cape Town, South Africa.

Apparently, there has been studies to map informal settlements with different machine learning algorithm. @chamunorwa2024 tried to compare 4 machine learning algorithm to detect informal settlement using Gradient Boost, KNN, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine \[SVM\] with data extracted from cloud computing repositories. Each of these are valued because:

-   KNN : simplicity in classification tasks (effective for well-defined clusters).

-   Gradient Boosting : its ability to improve performance through the sequential combination of weak models, (capturing complex interactions within the data)

-   Random Forest : an ensemble method, is good at managing high-dimensional data and deal with overfitting

-   SVM : strong in classifying data with clear margins by creating optimal decision boundaries.

Overall, the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models were found to be the most effective for delineating informal settlements with accuracy of 89.07 % for RF and 89.05 for Gradient Boosting. It is amazing to see how this machine learning can capture the different cluster of informal settlements.
