# Xaringan

Lecture this week reminded me of one of powerful figure in Uchiha Clan, the one who can manipulate reality once he activates this-so-called Xaringan. Well, but this Xaringan is not related to figures in Konoha's world but related to a certain library in R Studio that enable us to create neat HTML slides in R.

# How's xaringan look like?
