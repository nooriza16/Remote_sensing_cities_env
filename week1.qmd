# Week 1 : Getting to Know Remote Sensing

-   **Sneak Peak**

This week is an introduction of Remote Sensing courses, introducing 2 sources of imagery :

1.  Landsat-8

2.  Sentinel 2A

    Each has their own characteristics, while Sentinel-2A has 10m spatial resolution Landsat-8 has 30m resolution. If we want to compare its spectral resolution we have to either upgrade or downgrade, usually downgrading the higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (10m) to match Landsat’s (30m) is the preferred approach.

# Application

**In what ways can we use Sentinel and Landsat data?**

-   Sentinel-2 (operated by ESA) has *13 spectral bands* across a wide range of wavelengths, which are especially useful for vegetation monitoring, land cover classification, and agricultural applications.

-   Landsat 8 (operated by NASA and USGS) has *11 spectral bands*, which cover a similar range of wavelengths to Sentinel-2 but with fewer bands. Landsat 8 provides excellent coverage for land monitoring and vegetation studies as well.

**They both could be use to vegetation monitoring, well........are they really that difference?**

-   Sentinel-2 has more bands overall, with additional Red Edge bands, a higher spatial resolution (10m for key bands), and a Water Vapor band. This makes it more suited for detailed vegetation analysis, agricultural monitoring, and atmospheric studies.

-   Landsat 8, while having fewer bands, provides excellent coverage with a broader range of SWIR bands, and the addition of two thermal infrared bands makes it strong for land surface temperature and other thermal analyses.
