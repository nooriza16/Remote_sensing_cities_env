## **Summary**

This week, the lecture covers an introduction of remote sensing, such as its vast application, instruments, collection method, and things we have to consider when we deal with remote sensing data. I tried to make the summary using visualization below to make it easier to understand.

During the practical, we explore several tools to deal with remote sensing data such as SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) and R-studio to plot spectral signature. We are also introduced with 2 imagery : Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8. It is interesting how this two imagery has a global coverage and for FREE. Both of them has spectral bands that could be useful for vegetation monitoring, land cover classification, and agricultural applications. We could benefit from Sentinel-2 frequent observations to monitor rapid changes. Meanwhile, Landsat data allows us to do large areas and long-term vegetation monitoring as it has extensive historical archive and consistent global coverage. Below I discussed the application of both Landsat and Sentinel in a vegetation analysis.

## **Application**

> **Landsat for monitoring accross vast region : Detecting of vegetation evolution across China Urban Development**

-   When I mentioned Landsat have a vast amount of historical data, [@han2025] explores this historical archive of 30 years Landsat data (spanning of landsat 5 to 8) on 2.125 city to monitor the vegetation evolution, using reflective bands such as Blue, green, red, NIR and SWIR (1 and 2) and highlighting vegetation characteristics using NDVI, EVI, and OSAVI. The NDVI and RGB bands were further processed to derive texture variables, including variance, contrast, entropy, angular second moment, and correlation. These texture metrics capture spatial patterns and fine-scale structural details of urban vegetation that may not be visible through spectral bands alone. The findings will classify vegetation in urban area, whether it is decreasing or increasing over time.

However, Landsat is an optical imaging system that is often **susceptible to cloud cover** and has limitations in distinguishing different vegetation types based solely on spectral characteristics. Imagine studying a mountainous region where cloud cover is persistent—using optical images like Landsat for vegetation monitoring and identification would be challenging. To address this issue, @li2023a utilized Sentinel-1, which operates with C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), enabling vegetation mapping under all weather conditions. The SAR data from Sentinel-1, when combined with the optical imagery of Sentinel-2, allows for the production of high-resolution maps that effectively differentiate bamboo forests from other vegetation types. This integration helps overcome the limitations of optical data in vegetation monitoring, where mixed spectral characteristics often lead to uncertainty in distinguishing bamboo from other forest types.

During my time understanding this paper, I was thinking that Landsat's vast amount of historical data has the potential to serve as a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of the **government's long-term** plan on urban greening. t must be challenging for the current government to evaluate which planning schemes have led to present conditions without access to extensive historical data. As a result, assessing the effectiveness of previous plans, identifying trends, and making informed adjustments for future development becomes difficult. For instance, in my country, Indonesia, we have long-term regional planning spanning 20 years, with reviews every five years. However, making accurate projections over such a long period can be challenging, even with periodic reviews. By utilizing Earth observation and historical imagery, we can improve our ability to project urban greenery developments and implement more realistic and measurable strategies

## Reflection

*Remote sensing provides diversity in data source, but.... will the implementation be easy?*

After exploring the application of the two selected satellites during practical this week, I have concluded that remote sensing data is particularly effective for analyzing large-scale and long-term variations. It can help to mitigate the high costs of manual data collection across vast regions. This insight made me reflect a lot on a similar challenge in my country. We often have challenges to find dataset for spatial analysis as we rely much on vector data, if any it would be outdated. Using remote sensing data not only allows us to have more updated data but also allows us to explore various potential variables derived from satellite imagery. However I must admit despite the potential of remote sensing, its adoption in the government sector—especially at the local level—remains limited. From my experience, this is largely due to a lack of human resources with the skills to process and analyze remote sensing data. For end users, the adoption of remote sensing is heavily linked with the information they can bring on the table, and often might depend on the leadership, budgetary constraints, procedures and personal capacity [@nationalacademyofsciences.2003].

Future Applications: I want to use remote sensing to map and analyze how river meandering evolves after the rainy season in my hometown. I have wanted to do this mini-project for years, but since I have not yet fully understood the methods and applications of remote sensing, I have not been able to accomplish it. This interest stems from my childhood observations—back then, the distance between the settlement and the river felt quite far. However, in recent years, I have noticed that the river has become visible from just a kilometer away from my house. In fact, around 2022, during a particularly heavy rainy season, the embankment collapsed, causing a house to be swept away into the river. Honestly, that accident often haunts me when the rainy season arrives. I just want to verify if my observations are accurate through remote sensing analysis and understand the potential risks for future precautions
