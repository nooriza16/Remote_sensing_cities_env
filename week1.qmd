## **Summary**

This week the lecture covers an introduction of remote sensing is, such as its vast application, instruments, collection method, and things we have to consider when we deal with remote sensing data. I tried to make the summary using visualization below to make it easier to understand.

During the practical, we explore several tools to deal with remote sensing data such as SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) and R-studio to plot spectral signature. We are also introduced with 2 imagery : Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8. It is interesting how this two imagery has a global coverage and for FREE. Both of them has spectral bands that could be useful for vegetation monitoring, land cover classification, and agricultural applications. We could benefit from Sentinel-2 frequent observations to monitor rapid changes. Meanwhile, Landsat data allows us to do large areas and long-term vegetation monitoring as it has extensive historical archive and consistent global coverage. Below I discussed the application of both Landsat and Sentinel in a vegetation analysis.

## **Application**

> **Landsat for monitoring accross vast region : Detecting of vegetation evolution across China Urban Development**

-   @han2025 explores 30 years of landsat archive data (spanning of landsat 5 to 8) on 2.125 city to monitor the vegetation evolution, using reflective bands such as Blue, green, red, NIR and SWIR (1 and 2) and highlighting vegetation characteristics using NDVI, EVI, and OSAVI. The NDVI and RGB bands were further processed to derive texture variables, including variance, contrast, entropy, angular second moment, and correlation. These texture metrics capture spatial patterns and fine-scale structural details of urban vegetation that may not be visible through spectral bands alone. The findings will classify vegetation in urban area, whether it is decreasing or increasing over time. I genuinely believe this finding has the potential to serve as a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of the government's long-term plan on urban greening. For instance in my country, Indonesia we have long-term regional planning that spanning for 20 years (reviewed every 5 years), the analyisis will help the policy maker to formulate more measured-target.

However, Landsat is an optical imaging system that is often susceptible to cloud cover and has limitations in distinguishing different vegetation types based solely on spectral characteristics. Imagine studying a mountainous region where cloud cover is persistentâ€”using optical images like Landsat for vegetation monitoring and identification would be challenging.

To address this issue, Li et al. (2023) utilized Sentinel-1, which operates with C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), enabling vegetation mapping under all weather conditions. The SAR data from Sentinel-1, when combined with the optical imagery of Sentinel-2, allows for the production of high-resolution maps that effectively differentiate bamboo forests from other vegetation types. This integration helps overcome the limitations of optical data in vegetation monitoring, where mixed spectral characteristics often lead to uncertainty in distinguishing bamboo from other forest types.

## Reflection

After exploring the application of the two selected satellites, I have concluded that remote sensing data is particularly effective for analyzing large-scale and long-term variations. It can also help mitigate the high costs of manual data collection across vast regions. This insight made me reflect on a similar challenge in my country, Indonesia. We often have challenges to find datasets for spatial analysis as we rely much on vector data, if any it would be outdated. Using remote sensing data not only allows us to have more updated data but also allows us to explore various potential variables derived from satellite imagery.
