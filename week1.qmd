# Week 1 : Getting to Know Remote Sensing

-   **Sneak Peak**

This week is an introduction of Remote Sensing courses, introducing 2 sources of imagery :

1.  Landsat-8

    The Landsat 8 satellite has a 16-day revisit cycle, meaning it can capture imagery of the same location every 16 day. This period would be advantageous to monitor changes at moderate pace, as its revisit time is every 16 days.

2.  Sentinel 2A

    Sentinel 2 revisits the earth every 5 days (using both satellite A and B), meaning that it provides frequent observations and make it suitable to monitor rapid changes.

    Each has their own characteristics, while Sentinel-2A has 10m spatial resolution Landsat-8 has 30m resolution. If we want to compare its spectral resolution we have to either upgrade or downgrade, usually downgrading the higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (10m) to match Landsat’s (30m) is the preferred approach.

# Application

**In what ways can we use Sentinel and Landsat data?**

-   Sentinel-2 (operated by ESA) has *13 spectral bands* across a wide range of wavelengths, which are especially useful for vegetation monitoring, land cover classification, and agricultural applications.

-   Landsat 8 (operated by NASA and USGS) has *11 spectral bands*, which cover a similar range of wavelengths to Sentinel-2 but with fewer bands. Landsat 8 provides excellent coverage for land monitoring and vegetation studies as well.

**They both could be used to vegetation monitoring, well........are they really that difference?**

-   Sentinel-2 has more bands overall, with additional Red Edge bands, a higher spatial resolution (10m for key bands), and a Water Vapor band. This makes it more suited for ***detailed vegetation analysis***, agricultural monitoring, and atmospheric studies. In the paper.....

-   Landsat 8, while having fewer bands, provides excellent coverage with a broader range of SWIR bands, and the addition of two thermal infrared bands makes it strong for land surface temperature and other ***thermal analyses**.*
