Today’s lecture is exploring the sensor imagery called synthetic aperture radar. The way it functions is like a bat, where it emits sound and then the sound will be reflected by things surrounding the bat.

Its application:

a.      In for flooding

Its black and white, because it goes from low (0 values) and high values, smaller portion of signals returning back to satellite the lower the value it is.

Ø What does the flooded area appear dark in the previous image?

Ø Calm water (and smooth surfaces) reflects the radar pulses away from the sensor

Ø Rough surfaces reflect in all directions - more is sent back to the sensor

There are 2 scattering method:

a.    Rough scattering \> scattering the signals in many scattering way

b.    Volume scattering \>

c.    Double bounce scattering \>

SAR Polarization

1.   V-v

2.   V-h

## Application

I would like to mention the application of **optical remote sensing versus SAR Imagery** in a research area that was initially unfamiliar to me but has become one of my interest in recent years. This week's topic would be **damage detection during conflict.**

During conflict, the need to assess building damage is crucial for humanitarian relief efforts. However, in the past the detection depended on eyewitness reports and manual detection. We know that time is precious during conflict and humanitarian aids. This calls [@mueller2021] to generate damage monitoring using Very High Resolution satellite imagery, good for its ever-higher resolution and frequency, and using machine learning techniques. The intuition behind the method is using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learns from example of destruction (e.g rubble and bomb raters) to make predictions about other images. Then to address the challenges of limited amount of labeled data (because sometimes the destruction is sparse or only limited buildings destroyed), they use label-augmentation technique which assumed destroyed at a certain time building will remain destroyed in subsequent time. This assumption helps to create additional labels for training dataset. The result is shown below, showing damage before and after a significant heavy weaponry attack in a neighborhood of Aleppo, with red indicates patch that is destroyed.
