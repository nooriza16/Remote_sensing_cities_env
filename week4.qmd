We know how remote sensing could benefit us in terms of scaling-analysis, temporal analysis, and its rich information derived within a single imagery. However, today’s class is exploring the gap between the potential of remote sensing to its utilization in policy formation.

Project Case : A New Relocated Capital City of Indonesia : Nusantara

## Summary

Recently Indonesia moved its capital city from Jakarta (in Java islands) into Penajam Paser City (Borneo Islands), as

## Reflections

During this week, I got a lot of reflections on my mind because finally I found lecture that explicitly bridging the gap of ‘academics’ to real-world policy. One the most important key-takeaway from the lecture is that “some academics papers are too technical, without clearly addressed policy; some policy don’t include academic findings they could benefit for”.

My reflections would be:

1.  I resonate a lot with the lecture’s key takeaway as I genuinely think academics and urban governance still have a distance between them. In terms of human resources, that make the adoption of academics finding hard to implement in governments. Besides, government project is based on annual budget which is make it a fast-paced environment that need an immediate output which make them reluctant to go through experimental phase often found in academics processes.

2.  I used to naively think that all published papers *in a renowned journals site* near perfect that It would be hard to find its weakness points. Surprisingly after this week’s lecture I found a lot of journals’s weakness point “If I could called it that way” pertaining to application of x y z methods applied to support urban planning does not explicitly link to specific policy. In my opinion, this is one of the reasons why academics and policy-making feel disconnected and fail to effectively influence each other

3.  What have I learnt about policy, city, and the RS data? In my opinion, using Remote Sensing Data on policy-making in city will generate more-informed policy that contained points it often misses such as where is exactly the place “The location” of the targeted policy. Everything happened somewhere. Additionally, it can serve as an alternative when dealing with the unavailability of baseline data.
