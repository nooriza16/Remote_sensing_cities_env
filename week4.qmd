## Summary

Recently Indonesia planned to move its capital city from Jakarta (in Java islands) into Penajam Paser Utara City (Borneo Islands), as the current capital city, Jakarta, faced an issue of sinking, land subsidence, overcrowding, low air and water quality [@bappenas2021]. The term Nusantara is used to name this new capital city, symbolizing the varied geographic settings and cultural diversities of Indonesia.

As for the time this published, Nusantara Development is on the phase 2 (2025-2029) that involved strengthening core area (housing, office, commercial zone). Thus, in the time being, Jakarta will still remain the capital of Indonesia until the Presidential Decree on the transfer of the capital to Nusantara is issued. The issuance of this decree will depend on the readiness of the new capital city, including the preparation of all supporting systems such as infrastructure, human resources, and governance systems.

The new capital city, Nusantara, is designed as a **forest city**, with 75% of its designated area being green space. This design aims to create a harmonious blend of urban development and biodiversity hotspots (Borneo Island, where Nusantara is located, is famous for its tropical rainforests). However, the design of being a forest city, its proximity to the rainforest, and its drive on landscape change would present significant **challenges**. One of the major concerns is the increasing likelihood of mosquito-borne diseases (such as **malaria**) spreading in the new capital, which are prevalent in tropical regions [@surendra2024]. Since malaria is both a global and local challenge, certain goals should be considered to support Nusantara's sustainability, such as:

### Policy

**A. Global Goals :** Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3.3 : Fight Communicable Diseases

The SDGs propose achievable global in combating malaria with target that in include reducing incident, mortality rates, eliminate malaria in 35 countries by 2030 and prevent resurgence of the disease in a malaria-free country. To achieve target of Global Goals, [@who2021] have launched global technical strategy for malaria with framework such as:

**B.National Level :** National Action Plan for Acceleration of Malaria Elimination 2020-2026

Meanwhile, in national level the malaria elimination taskforce is under Minsitry of Health and this national action plan become the fundamental handbook for provincial level. Below are the goals targetted by both the national and provincial level. Notice that provincial level targetted malaria elimination 3 years sooner !

## Application

> Remote Sensing as Baseline for detecting malaria hotspot

In malaria elimination projects, remote sensing can serve as a crucial baseline data source for mapping malaria hotspots by integrating climatic and land-use factors. \@wimberly2021 proposed a framework that leverages Earth observation products to identify mosquito habitats based on climate conditions, human activities, and specific land-use patterns.

To address policy mentioned in section 2, I underlined some dataset that could be used to the analysis:

## Reflections

During this week, I got a lot of reflections as I finally found lecture that explicitly bridging the gap of ‘academics’ to real-world policy. My reflections would be:

1.  Combining remote sensing with GIS

    Since Nusantara is still uninhabited, we could model nearby settlements to investigate the remote sensing framework. By combining the results with malaria incident data, we can validate our classification—analyzing what percentage of high-risk areas have recorded incidents and which have not. While global and local malaria elimination frameworks mention aggregating incident data and risk levels, they do not explicitly emphasize mapping. Using maps, we can overlay malaria hotspots with incident data, land use, and socio-economic factors. As @naserrudin2023 notes, people are exposed to malaria due to professions that require them to venture deeper into the forest.

2.  Remote Sensing and GIS is good, but enriching the analysis with **affected communities** make it better

    Beyond remote sensing data, incorporating local knowledge can improve the analysis. Understanding how affected communities respond to malaria provides insight into the effectiveness of mitigation efforts [@naserrudin2023a]. These communities have lived near rainforests for generations and are directly affected, making their experiences valuable for practical prevention strategies.

3.  Dealing with challenges by stakeholders' collaboration

    One the most important key-takeaway from the lecture is that “some academics papers are too technical, without clearly addressed policy; some policy don’t include academic findings they could benefit for." This condition lead to a gap between academics and urban governance. However, in my observation during my work with the government the potential cause is human resources (make the adoption of academics finding hard to implement), annual budget cycles (governments prioritize immediate results and may be reluctant to invest in the long-term experimental processes typical of academia). Bridging the gap on malaria prevention requires collaboration and commitment not only between epidemiologists, healthcare, and geospatial analysts but with the governments to ensure research translates into actionable policies.
