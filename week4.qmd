## Summary

Recently Indonesia planned to move its capital city from Jakarta (in Java islands) into Penajam Paser Utara City (Borneo Islands), as the current capital city, Jakarta, faced an issue of sinking, land subsidence, overcrowding, low air and water quality [@bappenas2021]. The term Nusantara is used to name this new capital city, symbolizing the varied geographic settings and cultural diversities of Indonesia.

As for the time this published, Nusantara Development is on the phase 2 (2025-2029) that involved strengthening core area (housing, office, commercial zone). In the time being, Jakarta will remain the capital of the country until the Presidential Decree on the transfer of the capital to Nusantara is issued. The issuance of this decree will depend on the readiness of the new capital city, including the preparation of all supporting systems such as fiscal, human resources, and monetary systems.

The analysis is done on initial process, so the detailed planning documents haven’t been launched. Thus, I use several Governments Published Documents, all of them are publicly available, such as:

1.  [Nusantara Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Voluntary Local Review Baseline \[2024\]](https://www.ikn.go.id/storage/pedoman-nusantara/2/nusantara-vlr-baseline-en.pdf)
2.  [Nusantara Biodiversity Management Master Plan](https://ikn.go.id/storage/pedoman-nusantara/1/nusantara-biodiversity-management-master-plan-2024.pdf) \[2024\]

The new capital city, Nusantara, is designed as a **forest city**, with 75% of its designated area being green space. This design aims to create a harmonious blend of urban development and one of the richest biodiversity hotspots in the world (Borneo Island, where Nusantara is located, is famous for its tropical rainforests).

However, relocating to Nusantara and designing to be a forest city, presents significant **challenges**. One of the major concerns is the increasing likelihood of mosquito-borne diseases (such as **malaria**) spreading in the new capital, which are prevalent in tropical regions. @surendra2024.

Addressing this risk is essential, as Nusantara aims to become a sustainable city that aligns with Sustainable Development Goals. However, there hasn't been any mitigating malaria risk framework yet from the government as the focus is still on infrastructure development.

## Application

By remote sensing the government could create framework that allows monitoring of environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and vegetation, which are critical for understanding the habitats of mosquitoes.

## Reflections

During this week, I got a lot of reflections on my mind because I finally found lecture that explicitly bridging the gap of ‘academics’ to real-world policy. One the most important key-takeaway from the lecture is that “some academics papers are too technical, without clearly addressed policy; some policy don’t include academic findings they could benefit for”.

My reflections would be:

1.  What have I learnt about policy, city, and the RS data?

    Using Remote Sensing Data on malaria-related policy-making will generate more informed execution

2.  Additionally, it can serve as an alternative when dealing with the unavailability of baseline data.

3.  Aside from remote sensing data, I would like to combine the analysis by incorporating local wisdom in responding to Malaria. This approach would enhance the understanding of how to mitigate this issues, as these communities have lived for a long time near the rainforest and are directly affected.
